<h1>What Denta-kun does inside</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Denta-kun is program written in C. denta-kun.h is header file included by 
main.c and poly-funcs.c. main.c mostly does parsing of given input.
poly-fucns.c includes codes for functions which start with 'poly'.
</p>
<p>
When you see the definitions of functions, you may see a keywords 'mut' or 'unmut'.
Those are key words that are used to notice you (and me) that whether the variable is
going to be modified or not. If a declaration has keyword 'unmut', then a variable declared
will not be modified at all. That is to say, objects that are pointed by objects declared 'unmut'
does not be modified. It is your responsibility to not to moddify 'unmut' objects and objects
pointed by 'unmut' objects. As you guessed, 'mut' variables are mostlikely going to be modified.
mut and unmut is defined in denta-kun.h as "nothing". In future release, 'unmut' may be defined 
as a keyword 'const', but I don't want to do this right now because doing it may cause compilation error.
