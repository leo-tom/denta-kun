Denta-kun is an application that calculates Grobner bases from given generators.
It takes tex-like input, and outputs tex-like text expressing a grobner base of it.

To compile it, just execute make without any options. It is still in development. Therefore,
it may not even compile.

This program is written for the class 'Seminar 1' of Department of Computer Science, Chiba Institude of Technology.
