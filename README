Denta-kun is an application that calculates Groebner bases from given generators.
It takes tex-like input, and outputs tex-like text expressing a Groebner base of it.

To compile it, you need to install GMP library which you can get from :
	https://gmplib.org/
After you successary installed GMP library, move to root directory of dentakun, and execute make.

After you finished compiling, you may want to install dentakun into your system. You can do it by executing
	make install
with root priviledge.

There are 2 executable binary dentakun and bentakun. dentakun is used to calculate polynomials using rational numbers.
bentakun is used to calculate polynomials using boolean.

To run it, give commands to a generated binary. For instance, execute following command to calculate Groebner basis.
####################################
echo 'f_1 = x^3 - 3x^2-x_1 + 1 \\
f_2 = x_1^2 - x^2  - 1 \\
I = f_1,f_2 \\
I = \SRT(PLEX,I) \\
G = \BBA(I) \\
\PP(G)\\' | dentakun

bentakun also has functionality to peform as ECD(Elementary Cellular Automaton). Try executing
	dentakun-bca-tool <rule>
where <rule> is a integer between 0 to 255. You can specify Wolfram code through <rule>.
If you like to see how all ECDs works, you would like to do :
	cd pics
	./generator.sh
It will generate all ECDs whose Wolfram codes are 0 to 255. Additionaly, it makes gif image combining all ECDs.
