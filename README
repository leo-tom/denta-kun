Denta-kun is an application that calculates Groebner bases from given generators.
It takes tex-like input, and outputs tex-like text expressing a Groebner base of it.

To compile it, you need to install GMP library which you can get from :
	https://gmplib.org/
After you successary installed GMP library, move to root directory of dentakun, and execute make.

To run it, give commands to a generated binary. For instance, execute following command to 
calculate Groebner basis. Make sure you remove '$' when you type following commands.

I = f_1,f_2 \\
I = \SRT(PLEX,I) \\
G = \BBA(I) \\
