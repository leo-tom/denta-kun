<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
This document is about Dentakun. Dentakun is software which is capable of calculating numbers and polynomials.
Dentakun was originally developed to make my understanding to Groebner basis.
Dentakun is also capable of expressing cellular automaton.
</p>
<h1>How to use Dentakun</h1>
<h2>Basic syntax</h2>
<h3>Basics</h3>
<p>
First, look at following code of Dentakun. It defines 3 polynomials. They are named f1,f2, and f3.
You need to append "\\" each line to tell Dentakun that this is end of a line.
Dentakun ignores newline character, so you can insert it anyware you want.
<div style="text-align: left;"><span>
f1 = x_2 x_1 x_0 - 1 \\ <br>
f2 = (x_1+x_2) x_0+x_2 x_1 \\ <br>
f3 = x_0+x_1+x_2 \\ <br>
I = f1,f2,f3 \\ <br>
I = \SRT(LEX,I) \\ <br>
G = \BBA(I) \\ <br>
\PP(G) \\  <br>
</span></div>
</p>
<p>
The 4th line of code defines "list" of polynomials with f1, f2, and f3. 5th line of code redefines variable "I" with
return value of function "SRT". when you call function in Dentakun, you need to write "\" before the name of function.
"SRT" function sorts a polynomial or all polynomials in the list. In this example, polynomials are sorted using Lexical order.
There are 3 orders available : LEX, RLEX, PLEX. RLEX is reversed version of LEX. PLEX ignores degrees of polynomial and do
"pure" lexical ordering. Note that LEX does care degree of each monomials when sorting.
</p>
<p>
The 6th line of code calculates Groebner basis of I using Buchberger algorithm. 
</p>
<p>
The 7th line of code prints out calculated Groebner basis. Usually, Dentakun print outs nothing unless a function "PP" is called.
By the way, PP stands for "print polynomial". Also, PP is nickname for my girlfriend. I hope this relationship lasts for long so that
I don't need to rewrite this document while suffering from regrets.
</p>
<h3>Variable</h3>
<p>
Use '=' to define constants. For instance, to make value of LEGALISE 420, do :
<div style="text-align: center;">LEGALISE = 420 \\</div>
If you want to name indexed constants you do as you would :
<div style="text-align: center;">
a_1 = 123 \\<br>
a_2 = 456 \\<br>
</div>
</p>
<p>
You cannot use 'x' as name of constants you define. 'x' is used to define polynomial.
You can make variables indexed using '_'. To specify degree of a variable, use '^'.
For example, definition of a unit circle would be :
<div style="text-align: center;">circle = x^2 + x_1^2 - 1 \\</div>
</p>

<p>
When you do not use '=' , say you just typed
<div style="text-align: center;">x^2 + x_1^2 - 1 \\</div>
the polynomial can be referenced from variable named "$n" where n is current line number. 
</p>

<p>
There are some pre-defined variables. Here are list of it :

<h1>What Denta-kun does inside</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Denta-kun is program written in C. denta-kun.h is header file included by 
main.c and poly-funcs.c. main.c mostly does parsing of given input.
poly-fucns.c includes codes for functions which start with 'poly'.
</p>
<p>
When you see the definitions of functions, you may see a keywords 'mut' or 'unmut'.
Those are key words that are used to notice you (and me) that whether the variable is
going to be modified or not. If a declaration has keyword 'unmut', then a variable declared
will not be modified at all. That is to say, objects that are pointed by objects declared 'unmut'
does not be modified. It is your responsibility to not to moddify 'unmut' objects and objects
pointed by 'unmut' objects. As you guessed, 'mut' variables are mostlikely going to be modified.
mut and unmut is defined in denta-kun.h as "nothing".
</p>
<h2>Definition in denta-kun.h</h2>
In this section, I use the word "typedefed".
When I say A is typedefed B, that is equivalent to :
B is redefined to A using 'typedef' keyword.
Is anyone using this expression...?
<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>
Following table shows lists of Variables that are defined in denta-kun.h.
Additionaly, structure called 'Node' is defined in main.c.
Node is used to parse input and generate Poly and such.
<table border=1>
<caption>Variables</caption>
<tr><th>Name</th><th>Members</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
<tr>
	<td>K</td>
	<td>This is mpq_t in dentakun, char in bentakun</td>
	<td>
		K is used to store coefficients of an Item.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>N</td>
	<td>This is just "typedefed" uint64_t.</td>
	<td>
		N is used to store degrees of a variable in Item.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>MonomialOrder</td>
	<td>This is just "typedefed" enum whose members are LEX, RLEX, and PLEX.</td>
	<td>
		MonomialOrder is used to specify monomial order that is used to sort items.
		Although it can be used withought keyword 'enum' in source code, it is enum. 
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Item</td>
	<td>size_t size;K coefficient;N *degrees;</td>
	<td>
		This variable is used to express an item. Note that this is typedefed structure.
		'coefficient' is used to store coefficient of itself.
		'size' stores size of the 'degrees'. As its name suggests, degrees stores
		degrees of variables. A subscript of an variable is corresponded to an index in 'degrees'.
		Namely, a monomial x_0^4 x_1^7 x_3^2 would be expressed with the array : {4,7,0,2}.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Poly</td>
	<td>size_t size;Item *items;</td>
	<td>
	This variable is used to express a polynomial. Note that this is typedefed structure.
	'*items' stores an array of Item objects.
	'size' stores size of an array items and monomial order which is used to sort *items.
	Lower 60 bits of 'size' are used to store size of an array '*items'.
	Upper 4 bits of 'size' are used to store monomial order that is used to sort *items.
	Note that you should never access to 'size' directly. Use macros shown in following table.
	</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Macros</h3>
<p>
Following table shows macros that are defined in denta-kun.h.
All C functions takes copy of variables as parameters.
However, as they are being macro, they take parameters "as it is".
That is to say, they are able to change variable which you gave to following macros.
<table border=1>
<caption>Macros</caption>
<tr><th>Name</th><th>Return value</th><th>Parameters</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
<tr>
	<td>polySize</td>
	<td>size_t</td>
	<td>Poly p</td>
	<td>
		This macro returns size of 'p'.
		This macro does not mutate 'p'.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>	
	<td>polyType</td>
	<td>MonomialOrder</td>
	<td>Poly p</td>
	<td>
		This macro returns monomial order of 'p'.
		This macro does not mutate 'p'.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>setPolySize</td>
	<td>void</td>
	<td>Poly p,size_t s</td>
	<td>
		's' will be set as size of 'p'.
		This macro mutate 'p' but it does not mutate 's'.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>setPolyType</td>
	<td>void</td>
	<td>Poly p,MonomialOrder t</td>
	<td>
		't' will be set as monomial order of 'p'.
		This macro mutate 'p' but it does not mutate 't'.
	</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>
<p>
Following table shows functions that are defined in denta-kun.h
Note that the keyword 'unmut' is equivalent to 'const' keyword of C.
However, 'unmut' is actually defined as nothing in denta-kun.h.
It is because, although 'unmut' is used to tell programmers that a
function does not mutate variable, some functions mutate it and 
mutate it back to as it was.
I did this to make code shorter and faster. 
Also, you should note that variable with 'mut' keyword are to be
mutated in a function.
</p>
<p>
None of following functions which takes structure as parameter take pointer of structure.
That means, none of them are capable of mutating variable inside a structure.
However, they are able to objects that are pointed by pointer inside a structure.
'mut' and 'unmut' declare that whether such objects are going to be muted or not.

<caption>Macros</caption>
<tr><th>Definition</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
<tr>
	<td>Poly polyAdd(unmut Poly v1,unmut Poly v2)</td>
	<td>
		This fucntion sums up v1 and v2, and returns summed up newly generated Poly.
		Note that this function requires monomial order of v1 and v2 to be same.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>Poly polySub(unmut Poly v1,unmut Poly v2)</td>
	<td>
		This fucntion calculates 'v1 - v2', and returns newly generated Poly.
		Note that this function requires monomial order of v1 and v2 to be same.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>Poly polyMul(unmut Poly v1,unmut Poly v2)</td>
	<td>
		This fucntion multiply v1 and v2, and returns multiplied newly generated Poly.
		Note that this function requires monomial order of v1 and v2 to be same.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>Poly * polyDiv(unmut Poly dividend,unmut Poly *divisor,unmut size_t size);</td>
	<td>
		This fucntion returns "standard notation" of dividend by *divisor.
		It returns an array of newly generated Poly sized 'size + 1'.
		n-th object in its return value is polynomial which is quotient of n-th polynomial in '*divisor'.
		'size'-th object in its return value is remander of standard notation.
		'*divisor' is an array of Poly that are used to divide dividend by.
		'dividend' is Poly that are divided by polynomials given by '*divisor'.
		'size' must be size of an array given through '*divisor'.
